# 📊 Telco Customer Churn Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is a major challenge in the telecom industry, directly impacting recurring revenue. This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key factors influencing customer churn and provides actionable business insights to improve customer retention.

## 🎯 Business Objective
- Understand customer behavior related to churn
- Identify high-risk customer segments
- Support data-driven retention strategies

## 📂 Dataset
- **Domain:** Telecommunications
- **Records:** ~7,000 customers
- **Target Variable:** Churn (Yes / No)
- **Features:** Customer demographics, service usage, contract type, billing information

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Analysis Workflow
1. Business understanding & problem framing  
2. Data inspection and cleaning  
3. Target variable encoding  
4. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
5. KPI calculation (Churn Rate)  
6. Insight generation & business recommendations  

## 📈 Key Insights
- Customers on **month-to-month contracts** show the highest churn.
- **Short-tenure customers** are significantly more likely to churn.
- Higher **monthly charges** correlate with increased churn risk.
- Lack of **online security services** increases churn probability.

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- Promote long-term contracts using pricing incentives.
- Bundle online security and technical support services.
- Proactively identify and target high-risk customers using tenure and billing patterns.
